# Building Applications with Vector Databases

- Vector databases use embeddings to capture the meaning of data, gauge the similarity between different pairs of vectors, and navigate large datasets to identify the most similar vectors. 
- In LLMs, the primary use of vector databases is RAG, where text embeddings are stored and retrieved for specific queries. 
- The versatility of vector databases extends beyond RAG and makes it possible to build a wide range of applications quickly with minimal coding.
- Exploring the implementation of six applications using vector databases:
  * Semantic Search: Create a search tool that goes beyond keyword matching, focusing on the meaning of content for efficient text-based searches on a user Q/A dataset.
  * RAG: Enhance your LLM applications by incorporating content from sources the model wasnâ€™t trained on, like answering questions using the Wikipedia dataset.
  * Recommender System: Develop a system that combines semantic search and RAG to recommend topics, and demonstrate it with a news article dataset.
  * Hybrid Search: Build an application that finds items using both images and descriptive text, using an eCommerce dataset as an example.
  * Facial Similarity: Create an app to compare facial features, using a database of public figures to determine the likeness between them.
  * Anomaly Detection: Learn how to build an anomaly detection app that identifies unusual patterns in network communication logs.
